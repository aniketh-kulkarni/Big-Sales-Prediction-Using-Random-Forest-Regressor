Big Sales Prediction Using Random Forest Regressor

Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to predict sales of items using a Random Forest Regressor. The dataset contains information about various items and their sales across different outlets. The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts item outlet sales based on several features.

1. Import Libraries:
   - Necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn are imported for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

2. Import Data:
   - The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file hosted on GitHub.

3. Data Exploration:
   - Information about the dataset is explored using functions like `head()`, `info()`, `columns`, and `describe()`.

4. Handling Missing Values:
   - Missing values in the 'Item_Weight' column are imputed with the mean value based on the 'Item_Type' category.

5. Data Preprocessing:
   - Categorical variables are converted to numerical format for model compatibility.
   - Categories are mapped and replaced for variables like 'Item_Fat_Content', 'Item_Type', 'Outlet_Identifier', 'Outlet_Size', 'Outlet_Location_Type', and 'Outlet_Type'.

6. Data Visualization:
   - Data visualization is performed using a pair plot to understand relationships between variables.

7. Feature Standardization:
   - Standardization is applied to selected numerical features using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn.

8. *rain-Test Split:
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

9. Modeling (Random Forest Regressor):
   - A Random Forest Regressor is trained on the training data.

10. Prediction:
    - The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data.

11. Model Evaluation:
    - The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.

12. Visualization of Results:
    - A scatter plot is created to visualize the actual vs. predicted sales prices.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the process of building a sales prediction model using a Random Forest Regressor. The model's performance can be further improved by tuning hyperparameters or trying different regression algorithms. The visualization provides insights into how well the model predicts sales prices based on the given features.
